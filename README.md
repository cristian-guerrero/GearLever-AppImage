# GearLever AppImage

Automated CI to build GearLever as a standalone AppImage.

## Why this AppImage?
GearLever is normally distributed as a Flatpak. This version allows you to run it as a standalone executable that can **manage and integrate other AppImages**, including itself!

## How to Build
The CI uses a bundling strategy to ensure GTK4 and Libadwaita compatibility across different Linux distributions.
